# Robotisation

This audio plugin was submitted as part of coursework of the Digital Audio Effects module taken at Queen Mary University of London in 2015.

It was conceived as a rectangular bandpass filter in frequency domain whose cutoff frequencies are fixed to 1200 Hz and 3200 Hz to recreate a _robotic_ voice effect.
